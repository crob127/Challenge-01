# HTML: Challenge-01
Completed week 1 challenge

## Task

Modify starter code.

Refactoring existing code (improving it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology is a common task for front-end and junior developers. For this particular Challenge, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. 

## User Request

```
As a marketing agency
I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards
so that our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

A webpage that meets accessibility standards by including:
* Semantic HTML elements in the source code
* The HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Accessible alt attributes for each image
* Heading attributes that fall in sequential order
* A concise and descriptive title
